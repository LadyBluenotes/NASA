## General Info

From scratch, I wanted to create a project that showcased some of my more advanced vanilla JavaScript skills I've learned. The HTML and CSS created for this website were coded entirely by scratch as well as the JavaScript itself.

To add some more complexity to this project, I used JS to hide and create elements as well as change pre-exisiting ones. For example, the astronaut that is pictured on the first loading page is later replaced by a simple black background to better showcase the information that was pulled from the API. 

I did have some difficulties showcasing the different forms of media in this project as the API displays both images as well as videos, however, JS simplified what I would've anticipated as being a more complex program should I have just tried to make it work with CSS.

Overall, I'm proud of this project and how far I've come. This project marks the 6 month mark of my full-time coding journey.

## Technologies

Project was created using HTML5, CSS3, and ES13.

The API I used can be found (here)[https://api.nasa.gov/].
